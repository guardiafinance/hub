# CloudEvents

[CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io) is a standardized specification for representing events — that is, significant occurrences in distributed systems — in a common format. This standardization enables interoperability between services and platforms, ensuring traceability, auditability, and resilience through event-based asynchronous communication.

In modern architectures, this approach addresses challenges such as:
- **Interoperability** between services in different languages and platforms
- **Traceability** with essential metadata for auditing
- **Extensibility** to accommodate varied domains
- **Decoupling** between event producers and consumers
- **Standardization** according to widely adopted industry norms

## Event Structure

The following structure presents a visual summary of the expected properties in an event. Detailed rules and descriptions can be found in the [Properties](#properties) section.

- Maximum event size MUST be less than 64KB.

### Expected Behaviors

- MUST be published in distinct topics for each event type, following the naming pattern `event.guardia.{module}.{entity_type}.{event_name}`.
- Consumer systems MUST implement idempotency.
- Events MUST be consumed ensuring delivery order, maintaining temporal and causal consistency between related events.
- Events MUST be self-descriptive, containing all metadata necessary for processing and traceability.
- Systems MUST be able to validate events against defined schemas, ensuring structural and semantic data compliance.

### External Events

- External events that do not follow the Cloud Events pattern MUST be mapped to this standard.
- MUST be published in distinct topics for each event type, following the naming pattern `event.{provider}.{module}.{entity_type}.{event_name}`.

## When to Use

This specification MUST be used when:

- Implementing distributed systems that need to exchange events
- Building event-based architectures
- Integrating different services and platforms
- Consuming and propagating external events
- Implementing asynchronous messaging patterns

## When Not to Use

This specification MUST NOT be used for:

- Synchronous communication between services
- Large file transfers
- Continuous data streaming
- Real-time communication with low latency

## Security Considerations

- Events MUST be transmitted over secure channels (TLS)
- Sensitive data MUST be encrypted or obfuscated.
- Event access MUST be controlled by authentication and authorization mechanisms based on the [Authentication and Authorization](./authentication-and-authorization.md) specification.

## Additional Notes

- Systems MUST implement retry mechanisms for event delivery
- Consumers MUST be idempotent
- Systems MUST implement dead letter queue mechanisms for unprocessed events
